# City-Info
City Info is a free webapp that leverages numerous open APIs—OpenStreetMap, Nomination, Open‑Meteo, Open Elevation, Rest Countries, Wikidata, OpenAQ, Sunrise‑Sunset, Wikipedia, and DBpedia—to display comprehensive city data including maps, weather, elevation, air quality, and more. Developed by Bocaletto Luca.
